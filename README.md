# Flight Fare Prediction model
This is a machine learning the model for flight fare prediction for four metro cities of India.<br>

# Motivation
I started to learn machine learning to know in depth about AI and its working. I came to know concepts behind all machine learning models and algorithms. And it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

# Tools
This code is written in Google Colab. It has all the libraries required in doing machine learning projects. And the best part is it does not use up your system memory but works on virtual servers. And it is free if you are using it only for yourself.
